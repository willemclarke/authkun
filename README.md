- Lil project to gain a more thorough insight into jwt authentication with my own implementation.
- It is a simplistic implementation, no refresh tokens, only storing the jwt in localstorage, so it's definitly not the best way to do authentication by todays standards.
  - However, the goal of the project was to understand the structure of authentication better (which I think it succeeded in doing).
- If I was to implement auth for-real, would just use a a service like Auth0 which has it figured out.
