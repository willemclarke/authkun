Lil project to gain a more thorough insight into jwt authentication with my own implementation.

- It is a simplistic implementation, no refresh tokens and only storing the jwt in localstorage. So it's definitly not the best way to do authentication by todays standards. That being said, the goal of the project was to understand the structure of authentication better (which I think it succeeded in doing).
- If I was to implement auth in the real world, I would just use something like Auth0

- express
- postgresql (via [Slonik](https://github.com/gajus/slonik) and Docker)
